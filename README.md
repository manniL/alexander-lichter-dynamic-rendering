# Dynamic Rendering in 2024 - SSR only for Crawlers?

> **Note**
> This repository contains the code for the YouTube Video [Dynamic Rendering in 2024 - SSR only for Crawlers?](https://youtu.be/vHvfee1PD10).

In the video, I discuss the "dynamic rendering" approach for websites which focuses on serving server-side rendered content only to search engine crawlers. This approach is a middle ground between server-side rendering and client-side rendering, but if it is a good idea and how to implement it will be discussed in the video!
